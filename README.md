The main use case is to select what formatting to keep when copy-pasting rich text into an editor, for example from Word or Google Docs, addressing Draft.js limitations like [#166](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/166) and [#504](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/504). Check out the [online demo](https://thibaudcolas.github.io/draftjs-filters)!

> If you want to learn more about how this is used in practice, have a look at [Rethinking rich text pipelines with Draft.js](https://wagtail.org/blog/rethinking-rich-text-pipelines-with-draft-js/).

## Using the filters

First, grab the package from npm:

```sh
npm install --save draftjs-filters
```

Then, in your editor import `filterEditorState` and call it in the Draft.js `onChange` handler. This function takes two parameters: the filtering configuration, and the `editorState`.

```js
import { filterEditorState } from "draftjs-filters"

function onChange(nextState) {
  const { editorState } = this.state
  let filteredState = nextState

  const shouldFilterPaste =
    nextState.getCurrentContent() !== editorState.getCurrentContent() &&
    nextState.getLastChangeType() === "insert-fragment"

  if (shouldFilterPaste) {
    filteredState = filterEditorState(
      {
        blocks: ["header-two", "header-three", "unordered-list-item"],
        styles: ["BOLD"],
        entities: [
          {
            type: "IMAGE",
            attributes: ["src"],
            allowlist: {
              src: "^http",
            },
          },
          {
            type: "LINK",
            attributes: ["url"],
          },
        ],
        maxNesting: 1,
        whitespacedCharacters: ["\n", "\t", "ðŸ“·"],
      },
      filteredState,
    )
  }

  this.setState({ editorState: filteredState })
}
```

Here are all the available options:

```jsx
// List of allowed block types. unstyled and atomic are always included.
blocks: readonly string[]>,
// List of allowed inline styles.
styles: readonly string[]>,
// List of allowed entities.
entities: readonly []<{
  // Entity type, eg. "LINK"
  type: string,
  // Allowed attributes. Other attributes will be removed. If this is omitted, all attributes are kept.
  attributes?: readonly string[]>,
  // Refine which entities are kept by matching acceptable values with regular expression patterns.
  // It's also possible to use "true" to signify that a field is required to be present,
  // and "false" for fields required to be absent.
  // If this is omitted, all entities are kept.
  allowlist?: {
    [attribute: string]: string | boolean,
  },
}>,
// Maximum amount of depth for lists (0 = no nesting).
maxNesting: number,
// Characters to replace with whitespace.
whitespacedCharacters: Array<string>,
// Optional: Rules used to automatically convert blocks from one type to another
// based on the blockâ€™s text. Also supports setting the block depth.
// Defaults to the filtersâ€™ built-in block prefix rules.
blockTextRules?: readonly []<{
  // A regex as a string, to match against block text, e.g. "^(â—¦|o |o\t)".
  test: string,
  // The type to convert the block to if the test regex matches.
  type: string,
  // The depth to set (e.g. for list items with different prefixes per depth).
  depth: number,
}>,
```

### Deprecated

`filterEditorState` (and `shouldKeepEntityByAttribute` described further below) used to support a `whitelist` config option. It has been renamed to `allowlist`, and will be removed altogether in a future release.

### Types

If your project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), type inference should just work. If you don't use TypeScript, it won't get in your way either.

[Flow](https://flow.org/) types were included up to [v2.5.0](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/draftjs-filters/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#250-2020-11-21) of the package, and have been removed in v3.0.0.

### Advanced usage

`filterEditorState` isn't very flexible. If you want more control over the filtering, simply compose your own filter function with the other single-purpose utilities. The Draft.js filters are published as ES6 modules using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) â€“ module bundlers like Rollup and Webpack will tree shake (remove) the unused functions so you only bundle the code you use.

If using filters that remove blocks, be sure to use `applyContentWithSelection` to restore the selection where appropriate after filtering.

#### API

##### preserveAtomicBlocks

Creates atomic blocks where they would be required for a block-level entity
to work correctly, when such an entity exists.
Note: at the moment, this is only useful for IMAGE entities that Draft.js
injects on arbitrary blocks on paste.

###### Parameters

- `content` **ContentState**

##### resetAtomicBlocks

Resets atomic blocks to have a single-space char and no styles.
This is how they are stored by Draft.js by default.

###### Parameters

- `content` **ContentState**

##### removeInvalidAtomicBlocks

Removes atomic blocks for which the entity type isn't allowed.

###### Parameters

- `allowlist` **readonly {type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)}[]**
- `content` **ContentState**

##### removeInvalidDepthBlocks

Removes blocks that have a non-zero depth, and aren't list items.
Happens with Apple Pages inserting `unstyled` items between list items.

###### Parameters

- `content` **ContentState**

##### preserveBlockByText

Changes block type and depth based on the block's text. â€“ some word processors
add a specific prefix within the text, eg. "Â· Bulleted list" in Word 2010.
Also removes the matched text.
This is meant first and foremost for list items where the list bullet or numeral
ends up in the text. Other use cases may not be well covered.

###### Parameters

- `rules` **readonly {test: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), depth: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)}[]**
- `content` **ContentState**

##### limitBlockDepth

Resets the depth of all the content to at most max.

###### Parameters

- `max` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)**
- `content` **ContentState**

##### filterBlockTypes

Converts all block types not present in the list to unstyled.
Also sets depth to 0 (for potentially nested list items).

###### Parameters

- `allowlist` **readonly [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)[]**
- `content` **ContentState**

##### filterInlineStyles

Removes all styles not present in the list.

###### Parameters

- `allowlist` **readonly [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)[]**
- `content` **ContentState**

##### cloneEntities

Clones entities in the entityMap, so each range points to its own entity instance.
This only clones entities as necessary â€“ if an entity is only referenced
in a single range, it won't be changed.

###### Parameters

- `content` **ContentState**

##### filterEntityRanges

Filters entity ranges (where entities are applied on text) based on the result of
the callback function. Returning true keeps the entity range, false removes it.
Draft.js automatically removes entities if they are not applied on any text.

###### Parameters

- `filterFn` **function (content: ContentState, entityKey: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), block: BlockNode): [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)**
- `content` **ContentState**

##### shouldKeepEntityType

Keeps all entity types (images, links, documents, embeds) that are enabled.

###### Parameters

- `allowlist` **readonly {type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)}[]**
- `type` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)**

##### shouldRemoveImageEntity

Removes invalid images â€“ they should only be in atomic blocks.
This only removes the image entity, not the camera emoji (ðŸ“·) that Draft.js inserts.

###### Parameters

- `entityType` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)**
- `blockType` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)**

##### shouldKeepEntityByAttribute

Filters entities based on the data they contain.

###### Parameters

- `entityTypes` **readonly {type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), allowlist: {}?, whitelist: {}?}[]**
- `entityType` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)**
- `data` **{ [attr: string]: any }**

##### filterEntityData

Filters data on an entity to only retain what is allowed.
This is crucial for IMAGE and LINK, where Draft.js adds a lot
of unneeded attributes (width, height, etc).

###### Parameters

- `entityTypes` **readonly {type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), attributes: readonly [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>?}[]**
- `content` **ContentState**

##### replaceTextBySpaces

Replaces the given characters by their equivalent length of spaces, in all blocks.

###### Parameters

- `characters` **readonly [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)[]**
- `content` **ContentState**

##### applyContentWithSelection

Applies the new content to the editor state, optionally moving the selection
to be on a valid block, inserting one if needed.
See <https://github.com/thibaudcolas/draftjs-filters/issues/27>.

###### Parameters

- `editorState` **EditorState**
- `content` **ContentState**
- `nextContent` **ContentState**

##### filterEditorState

Applies filtering and preservation operations to the editor content,
to restrict it to supported patterns.
Will not alter the editor state if there are no changes to make.

###### Parameters

- `options` **FilterOptions**
- `editorState` **EditorState**

##### condenseBlocks

Condenses an array of content blocks into a single block.

- Skipping the undo-redo stack.
- Adding a space between each block to match the behavior of vanilla HTML fields.
- Making sure the space gets the correct styles or entities applied.
- Placing the selection at the same end offset as the last selection.

This exhibits two known issues:

- A link / other entity spread over multiple lines will be split into multiple entities of identical data.
- Upon redo-ing the change, the selection isnâ€™t correctly placed.

###### Parameters

- `nextState` **EditorState**
- `prevState` **EditorState**

### Browser support and polyfills

The Draft.js filters only support modern browsers with ES2020 features. Support for legacy browsers can be achieved, up to IE11, by appropriately transpiling the packageâ€™s code and including the [required Draft.js polyfills](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/docs/advanced-topics-issues-and-pitfalls).

#### IE11

There are [known Draft.js issues](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/986) with pasting in IE11. For now, we advise users to turn on `stripPastedStyles` in IE11 only so that Draft.js removes all formatting but preserves whitespace:

```jsx
const IS_IE11 = !window.ActiveXObject && "ActiveXObject" in window

const editor = <Editor stripPastedStyles={IS_IE11} />
```
