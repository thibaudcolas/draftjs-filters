> Filter [Draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/) content to preserve only the formatting you allow. Built for [Draftail](https://github.com/springload/draftail) and [Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail).

[![Screenshot of Microsoft Word with tens of toolbars activated](https://thibaudcolas.github.io/draftjs-filters/word-toolbars-overload.jpg)](https://thibaudcolas.github.io/draftjs-filters)

The main use case is to select what formatting to keep when copy-pasting rich text into an editor, for example from Word or Google Docs, addressing Draft.js limitations like [#166](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/166). Check out the [online demo](https://thibaudcolas.github.io/draftjs-filters)!

## Using the filters

First, grab the package from npm:

```sh
npm install --save draftjs-filters
```

Then, in your editor import `filterEditorState` and call it in the Draft.js `onChange` handler. This function takes two parameters: the filtering configuration, and the `editorState`.

```js
import { filterEditorState } from "draftjs-filters"

function onChange(nextState) {
  const { editorState } = this.state
  let filteredState = nextState

  const shouldFilterPaste =
    nextState.getCurrentContent() !== editorState.getCurrentContent() &&
    nextState.getLastChangeType() === "insert-fragment"

  if (shouldFilterPaste) {
    filteredState = filterEditorState(
      {
        blocks: ["header-two", "header-three", "unordered-list-item"],
        styles: ["BOLD"],
        entities: [
          {
            type: "IMAGE",
            attributes: ["src"],
            whitelist: {
              src: "^http",
            },
          },
          {
            type: "LINK",
            attributes: ["url"],
          },
        ],
        maxNesting: 1,
        whitespacedCharacters: ["\n", "\t", "ðŸ“·"],
      },
      filteredState,
    )
  }

  this.setState({ editorState: filteredState })
}
```

Here are the available options:

```jsx
// Whitelist of allowed block types. unstyled and atomic are always included.
blocks: Array<DraftBlockType>,
// Whitelist of allowed inline styles.
styles: Array<string>,
// Whitelist of allowed entities.
entities: Array<{
    // Entity type, eg. "LINK"
    type: string,
    // Allowed attributes. Other attributes will be removed.
    attributes: Array<string>,
    // Refine which entities are kept by whitelisting acceptable values with regular expression patterns.
    whitelist: {
      [attribute: string]: string,
    },
}>,
// Maximum amount of depth for lists (0 = no nesting).
maxNesting: number,
// Characters to replace with whitespace.
whitespacedCharacters: Array<string>,
```

### Advanced usage

`filterEditorState` isn't very flexible. If you want more control over the filtering, simply compose your own filter function with the other single-purpose utilities. The Draft.js filters are published as ES6 modules using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) â€“ module bundlers like Rollup and Webpack will tree shake (remove) the unused functions so you only bundle the code you use.

```jsx
/**
 * Creates atomic blocks where they would be required for a block-level entity
 * to work correctly, when such an entity exists.
 * Note: at the moment, this is only useful for IMAGE entities that Draft.js
 * injects on arbitrary blocks on paste.
 */

preserveAtomicBlocks((content: ContentState))

/**
 * Resets atomic blocks to have a single-space char and no styles.
 */

resetAtomicBlocks((content: ContentState))

/**
 * Removes atomic blocks for which the entity isn't whitelisted.
 */

removeInvalidAtomicBlocks((whitelist: Array<Object>), (content: ContentState))

/**
 * Removes blocks that have a non-zero depth, and aren't list items.
 * Happens with Apple Pages inserting `unstyled` items between list items.
 */

removeInvalidDepthBlocks((content: ContentState))

/**
 * Resets the depth of all the content to at most max.
 */

limitBlockDepth((max: number), (content: ContentState))

/**
 * Converts all block types not present in the whitelist to unstyled.
 * Also sets depth to 0 (for potentially nested list items).
 */

filterBlockTypes((whitelist: Array<DraftBlockType>), (content: ContentState))

/**
 * Removes all styles not present in the whitelist.
 */

filterInlineStyles((whitelist: Array<string>), (content: ContentState))

/**
 * Clones entities in the entityMap, so each range points to its own entity instance.
 * This only clones entities as necessary â€“ if an entity is only referenced
 * in a single range, it won't be changed.
 */
cloneEntities((content: ContentState))

/**
 * Filters entity ranges (where entities are applied on text) based on the result of
 * the callback function. Returning true keeps the entity range, false removes it.
 * Draft.js automatically removes entities if they are not applied on any text.
 */

filterEntityRanges(
  (filterFn: (
    content: ContentState,
    entityKey: string,
    block: ContentBlock,
  ) => boolean),
  (content: ContentState),
)

/**
 * Keeps all entity types (images, links, documents, embeds) that are enabled.
 */

shouldKeepEntityType((whitelist: Array<Object>), (type: string))

/**
 * Removes invalid images â€“ they should only be in atomic blocks.
 * This only removes the image entity, not the camera emoji (ðŸ“·) that Draft.js inserts.
 * If we want to remove this in the future, consider that:
 * - It needs to be removed in the block text, where it's 2 chars / 1 code point.
 * - The corresponding CharacterMetadata needs to be removed too, and it's 2 instances
 */

shouldRemoveImageEntity((entityType: string), (blockType: DraftBlockType))

/**
 * Filters entities based on the data they contain.
 */

shouldKeepEntityByAttribute(
  (entityTypes: Array<Object>),
  (entityType: string),
  (data: Object),
)

/**
 * Filters data on an entity to only retain what is whitelisted.
 */

filterEntityData((entityTypes: Array<Object>), (content: ContentState))

/**
 * Replaces the given characters by their equivalent length of spaces, in all blocks.
 */

replaceTextBySpaces((characters: Array<string>), (content: ContentState))
```

### Browser support and polyfills

The Draft.js filters follow the browser support targets of Draft.js. Be sure to have a look at the [required Draft.js polyfills](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/docs/advanced-topics-issues-and-pitfalls).

#### IE11

There are [known Draft.js issues](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/986) with pasting in IE11. For now, we advise users to turn on `stripPastedStyles` in IE11 only so that Draft.js removes all formatting but preserves whitespace:

```jsx
const IS_IE11 = !window.ActiveXObject && "ActiveXObject" in window

const editor = <Editor stripPastedStyles={IS_IE11} />
```
